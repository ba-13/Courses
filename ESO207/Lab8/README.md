# Lab Assignment 8

1. Implement Binary Search Trees. Implement (at least) `insert`, `search` and `delete`. Try to insert 5000 random numbers one by one. Then traverse the tree in inOrder. Finally, repeatedly find, print and delete the minimum item (for 1000 times)

2. Implement Priority Queues using  r-way heaps. "r" should be a parameter (with râ‰¥2). Implement (at least) insert, reduceKey and deleteMin. Try to insert 5000 random numbers (same as in Q1) one by one. Carry out deleteMin (and print) for 1000 times.
