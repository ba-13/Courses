# Lab Assignment 4

1. Implement bucket sort, with each bucket as a queue (implemented using linked list). You are free to (re)-use code of Lab 2.

2. Implement merge sort. You are not allowed to use recursion/pointers in this question.

3. Use time command to find running time for above programs and also heap sort (of last lab) for:

> N = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000

Please stop running a program as soon as running time for that program exceeds 3 minutes.
